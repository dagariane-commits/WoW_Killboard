## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added
- **1v1 Duel Match Engine**:
  - Full detection for duel challenges, forfeits ("fled"), and knockouts via `CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM` hooks.
  - Dedicated Duel Record tracking (`wins`, `losses`, `win %`) stored in `WoWKillboardDB.stats.duels`.
  - Independent `DUEL` filter context across in-game UI, sync engine, and web platform.
  - Certified 1v1 duel killmail classification (`isDuel = true`) distinct from world PvP.
- **Battleground Scoreboard & Match Telemetry**:
  - Event listeners for `UPDATE_BATTLEFIELD_SCORE`, `PVP_MATCH_COMPLETE`, and `UPDATE_BATTLEFIELD_STATUS`.
  - Automated tracking of Battleground Wins, Losses, and Win % stored in `WoWKillboardDB.stats.bgs`.
  - Real-time aggregation of player and lobby damage done, healing done, and objective score metrics.
- **Tactical 3-Card KPI Header**:
  - Redesigned in-game stat header into three wide, balanced telemetry cards (268px width each):
    1. `SESSION COMBAT K/D` (Cyan `#00e5ff`) — Active session kills, deaths, and K/D ratio.
    2. `1v1 DUELS RECORD` (Gold `#ffd700`) — Duel wins, losses, and win percentage.
    3. `BATTLEGROUNDS RECORD` (Blue `#00ccff`) — Battleground wins, losses, and win percentage.
- **Standalone Desktop Sync Binary (`WoWKillboardSync.exe`)**:
  - PyInstaller-compiled standalone 8.8 MB Windows executable.
  - Zero Python installation requirement for end users.
  - Multi-Drive Auto-Discovery scanning `C:`, `D:`, and `E:` drives for WoW installations across Retail, Classic, Classic Era, and Forever Beta.
- **Hotspot Conflict Zones & Bloodshed Rankings**:
  - Dedicated `Zone Intel` tab analyzing top casualty zones, localized choke points, and dangerous regions.
  - Added `Leaderboard:GetDeadliestZones(limit)` and `Leaderboard:GetTopZones(mode, limit)`.
- **Bounty Escrow & Oathbreaker Debt Ledger**:
  - Full player bounty placement system with anti-win-trade verification (level deltas, guild collusion protection, duplicate kill cooldowns).
  - "Wall of Shame" Debt Ledger branding players who default on bounty promises as **Oathbreakers**.
  - Proximity Wanted Debtor Radar triggering audio sirens and screen notifications when a debtor is nearby.
  - 1-click in-game redemption workflow via C.O.D. mail with a 10% administrative surcharge.

### Changed
- **In-Game Navigation & Filter Bar Overlap Elimination**:
  - Calibrated explicit widths for the 5 left navigation tabs: `Live Feed` (95px), `Leaderboards` (105px), `Bounties & Debt` (110px), `BG Gladiators` (100px), `Zone Intel` (88px) — Total 510px.
  - Re-proportioned the 4 right filter pills: `Duels` (54px), `BGs` (50px), `World` (56px), `All PvP` (62px) — Total 234px.
  - Created an **88px guaranteed clear margin** between `Zone Intel` and `Duels`, permanently eliminating button and text collisions across all screen resolutions and UI scales.
- **Excised Arena Context for Vanilla / Forever Parity**:
  - Removed rated Arena stat card and filter pill from the in-game dashboard to conform strictly with WoW Forever / Classic Vanilla design boundaries.
  - Updated killmail detail modal and feed formatters to focus on Duels, Battlegrounds, and Open World PvP.
- **Modern Dark Gunmetal Aesthetic**:
  - Standardized all frames on 1px razor borders (`Interface\Buttons\WHITE8X8`), dark slate backgrounds (`0.06, 0.07, 0.10, 0.97`), and custom class color hex palettes.

### Fixed
- **Blizzard UI Taint & Action Blocked Eradication**:
  - Completely eradicated Blizzard XML template dependencies (`UIPanelCloseButton`, `UIPanelButtonTemplate`, `BasicFrameTemplateWithInset`) across all frames.
  - Replaced Blizzard `UISpecialFrames` registration with custom ESC key down handlers (`SetPropagateKeyboardInput(false)` on modal hide), preventing secure button taint during combat lockdown.
  - Added strict `InCombatLockdown()` gating to frame dragging, sizing, and dialog creation.
- **Runtime Nil Method Error (`GetDeadliestZones`)**:
  - Fixed `UI.lua:747: attempt to call a nil value` by defining `LB:GetDeadliestZones(limit)` in `Leaderboard.lua` with multi-tier fallback checks in `UI.lua`.
- **Scoreboard Type Comparison Exception**:
  - Fixed `CombatTracker.lua: attempt to compare number with string` by wrapping `GetBattlefieldWinner()` comparisons in type-safe casts `(tonumber(winner) == pFactionIndex) or (tostring(winner) == tostring(pFaction))`.
- **Cross-Client Combat Log Unification**:
  - Resolved `COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED` payload incompatibility between modern 11.x client engines (payload-based arguments) and Classic 1.15.x engines (`CombatLogGetCurrentEventInfo()`).

### Added
- **Temporal Hostile Gang Clustering Algorithm**:

  - Non-invasive caching of target, mouseover, and nameplate data (level, class, race, faction, guild name).
- **Cryptographic Killmail Hashing (`Utils.lua`)**:
  - 32-bit FNV-1a hashing producing deterministic, tamper-resistant Kill IDs based on timestamp, killer GUID, victim GUID, and location.
- **P2P Addon Synchronization (`Sync.lua`)**:
  - P2P gossip protocol distributing killmails and bounties across `PARTY`, `RAID`, and `GUILD` addon communication channels via `C_ChatInfo`.

### Changed
- Refactored `CombatTracker.lua` to record damage and healing meters independently for all participants in a combat engagement.
